## Easy Hard Link

Sometimes we need to create hardlinks to several files.

As it is not possible to create several hadlinks at once or directly to directories, this small python program makes it possible just by specifying the source and destination:

Example:

` python easyhardlink.py /path/source_directory /path/destination_directory `

This is part of my python learning. Suggestions are always welcome!

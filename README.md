## Easy Hard Link

Script to create hardlinks to several files at once, including files in subdirectories.

As it is not possible to create several hardlinks at once or directly to directories, this small python program makes it possible just by specifying the source and destination:

` python easyhardlink.py /path/source_directory /path/destination_directory `

This is part of my learning. Suggestions are always welcome!
